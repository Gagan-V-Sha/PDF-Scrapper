# My Awesome PDF Scraping Project
Built using Python
This is a desktop and CLI tool that allows you to extract text from PDF files and interact with them using natural language questions. 
It leverages Google Gemini AI for answering questions based on PDF content, and provides both text and speech (TTS) responses. 
The app supports both a graphical interface (Tkinter) and a command-line interface.

## Features

- **Extract text from one or multiple PDF files**
- **Ask questions about the PDF content using AI (Gemini Pro)**
- **Text-to-speech (TTS) responses**
- **Voice input for questions (speech recognition)**
- **GUI (Tkinter) and CLI modes**
